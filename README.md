# SQL-Queries
I created questions based on a pizza store sample database from maven analytics and used MySQL to create queries to answer my questions. 
The span of dates in the dataset is January 1st 2015 -  December 31st 2015. 
My questions include: 
What is most and least popular pizza category? 
What pizza type that is most and least popular? 
What is the date with most amount of orders? 
What time of day is pizza is ordered most? Analyzing these times can help management with scheduling and how many people to schedule during different times of the day. 
What is the most popular size purchased? 
What month has the max and min sales? What are the sales per month? 
What is total amount of sales and orders? 
How much sales during holidays and weekends? 
What is the correlation of ingredients from the least and most popular pizzas and other pizza types? This will show what ingredients are used the most and might have to be ordered more frequently and what ingredients or pizza types could be taken off the menu.
