select distinct pt.category, count(od.order_id) as order_amt 
from order_details od 
join pizzas on pizzas.pizza_id = od.pizza_id
join pizza_types pt on pt.pizza_type_id = pizzas.pizza_type_id 
group by pt.category

---THIS BRINGS BACK TOTALS FOR EACH CATEGORY.
CLASSIC IS MOST POPULAR, CHICKEN IS LEAST POPULAR---


2--WHAT PIZZA TYPE IS MOST POPULAR? LEAST POPULAR?

select distinct pt.name, count(od.order_id) as order_amt
from order_details od
join pizzas on pizzas.pizza_id = od.pizza_id
join pizza_types pt on pt.pizza_type_id = pizzas.pizza_type_id
group by pt.name
order by order_amt desc limit 1;

---TO SHOW LEAST POPULAR, I TAKE OUT DESC FROM THE QUERY. 
THE CLASSIC DELUXE PIZZA IS MOST POPULAR, AND THE BRIE BARRE PIZZA IS LEAST POPULAR---


3---WHAT INGREDIENTS FOR THE MOST POPULAR PIZZA TYPE AND CHECK CONNECTING INGREDIENTS TO 
OTHER PIZZA TYPES.---

select ingredients from pizza_types
where pizza_type_id = 'classic_dlx';
select name, ingredients from pizza_types
where ingredients like '%Pepperoni%'
or ingredients like '%Red Onions%'
or ingredients like '%Red Peppers%'
or ingredients like '%Bacon%';

--FIRST, I CHECKED INGREDIENTS FROM THE CLASSIC DELUXE, THEN CHECKED CONNECTING INGREDIENTS
WHICH SHOWED A CORRELATION WITH 21 TYPES. THIS SHOWS THAT THESE INGREDIENTS MIGHT NEED TO BE ORDERED 
MORE FREQUENTLY THAN OTHERS.


4---SHOW INGREDIENTS FOR LEAST POPULAR AND CHECK CONNECTING INGREDIENTS TO OTHER PIZZA TYPES. 
THIS IS TO SHOW WHAT INGREDIENTS OR PIZZA TYPE TO GET RID OF.---

select ingredients from pizza_types

select name, ingredients from pizza_types
where ingredients like '%Brio Carre Cheese%'
or ingredients like '%Prosciutto%'
or ingredients like '%Carmelized Onions%'
or ingredients like '%Pears%'
or ingredients like '%Thyme%';

---THIS SHOWS THAT THERE IS NO CORRELATION OF INGREDIENTS BETWEEN THE BRIE CARRE PIZZA AND ANY
OTHER PIZZA TYPES BESIDES GARLIC(GARLIC IS IN MOST PIZZAS). WE NEED TO DECIDE IF WE WANT TO KEEP THE
BRIE CARRE, IT IS ONLY MADE IN A SMALL SIZE AND THE PRICE IS $23.65---

12---WHAT TIME OF DAY IS PIZZA MOST ORDERED? I SEPERATED THE TIME OF DAY BY POSSIBLE SHIFT TIMES
THIS WILL HELP US DETERMINE HOW MANY EMPLOYEES TO SCHEDULE DURING EACH 5 HOUR INCREMENT.---

union
select '7pm-11:59pm' as timeframe,count(*) as orderamt
from orders
where orders.time between '19:00:00' and '23:59:59';

SHOULD BE SCHEDULED---
